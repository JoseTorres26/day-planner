day-planner.
challenge for module 5 of UCF Bootcamp.
Started challenge by creating html and css. i made a basic outline and centered elements to closely resemble mock-up example. i then set up javascript and started with the date at the top. i then created classes and varibles for my time blocks. then set up a for loop and if conditional to determine background color of each timeblock dependant on time. i then set up an event listener on button to set input value in local storage. after setting up the button i then set up a get function to pull the information onto the page on refresh. then i did the same for all buttons creating variables for every button. lastly i cleaned the css and html and fixed any errors with class and id.
